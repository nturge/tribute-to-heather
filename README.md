# tribute-to-heather
◕ ◞ ◕ This project was made using https://netnet.studio
An experiment in Algorithmic composition in reference to Evan Roth's [Tribute to Heather](http://www.evan-roth.com/work/tribute-to-heather/). Like Evan's work, the site uses gifs from [heathersanimations.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20040123095913/http://heathersanimations.com/) and loops through functions to create a tiled composition from a single gif. The gif's size, position, and count are determined relative to the size of the document, creating variable arrangements for each user's screen. This site was written in javascript with the help of [netnet studio](https://netnet.studio). The site is live at https://nturge.github.io/tribute-to-heather/
